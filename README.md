==========

Materials for the Very Applied Methods workshop (April 25, 2014)


## Starting the slide show

If you just want to see the slides as a slideshow in your browser, [follow this link](http://www.rebeccaweiss.info/VAM-Python/VAM.slides.html)

You can also view them as a single HTML file, [follow this link](http://www.rebeccaweiss.info/VAM-Python/VAM.html)

If you want to download the slides as an IPython notebook, download one of the archives on the left (e.g. zip or tarball).

If you have `git` installed, clone the master branch of this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rjweiss/VAM-Python.git
```

If you have IPython 2.0+ installed, you can serve the slides locally with the following command:

```bash
ipython nbconvert VAM.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```
